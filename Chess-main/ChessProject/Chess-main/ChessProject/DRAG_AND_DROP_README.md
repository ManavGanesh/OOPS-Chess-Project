# Chess Drag and Drop Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the drag and drop functionality that has been added to the chess game for both AI and multiplayer modes.

## Implementation Details

### Added Features
The `TilePanel.java` class has been enhanced with comprehensive drag and drop functionality that works alongside the existing click-based movement system.

### Key Components

#### 1. Drag and Drop Fields
```java
private boolean isDragging = false;
private Point dragStartPoint;
private Tile draggedTile;
private JLabel draggedPieceIcon;
private Point initialIconPosition;
private Board chessBoard; // Reference for cleanup
```

#### 2. Mouse Event Handlers

##### Mouse Pressed (`handleMousePressed`)
- Validates if the user can start dragging a piece
- Checks turn validity for both AI and multiplayer modes
- Ensures the piece belongs to the current player
- Creates a visual representation of the dragged piece
- Sets the chosen tile for move validation

##### Mouse Dragged (`handleMouseDragged`)
- Updates the position of the dragged piece icon in real-time
- Follows the mouse cursor as the user drags

##### Mouse Released (`handleMouseReleased`)
- Determines the target tile where the piece was dropped
- Validates and executes the move if valid
- Cleans up the drag state
- Restores the board to its proper visual state

#### 3. Visual Feedback

##### `createDraggedPieceIcon()`
- Creates a scaled copy of the piece being dragged
- Adds it to the board panel as a floating layer
- Temporarily hides the original piece icon during drag

##### `cleanupDragState()`
- Removes the floating piece icon
- Restores the original piece icon
- Resets all drag-related state variables

#### 4. Move Execution

##### `executeMoveLogic()`
- Common logic for both click and drag operations
- Handles piece selection and move validation
- Supports all chess move types:
  - Regular moves
  - En passant
  - Castling
  - Pawn promotion

##### `executeMove()`
- Determines whether to execute locally (AI mode) or send to server (multiplayer)
- Tracks captured pieces
- Updates the board display
- Triggers AI moves when appropriate

##### `sendMoveToServer()`
- Handles multiplayer move transmission
- Supports offline mode fallback
- Manages move pending states
- Includes timeout handling

### Mode Support

#### AI Mode
- Drag and drop works seamlessly with AI opponents
- Immediate move execution and AI response
- Full support for all chess rules
- Visual feedback for last moves

#### Multiplayer Mode
- Server synchronization for moves
- Offline mode fallback when server is unavailable
- Move validation and timeout handling
- Turn-based gameplay with visual indicators

### User Experience

#### Dual Input Support
- Players can use either clicking or dragging to make moves
- Both methods are fully functional and can be mixed freely
- No configuration required - both work out of the box

#### Visual Feedback
- Dragged pieces follow the mouse cursor
- Clear visual indication of selected pieces
- Highlighted last moves with colored borders
- Turn indicators and game state display

#### Error Handling
- Invalid drops return the piece to original position
- Graceful handling of network disconnections
- Proper cleanup of drag state in all scenarios

### Technical Implementation

#### Thread Safety
- All UI updates are performed on the Event Dispatch Thread
- Proper synchronization for multiplayer operations
- Safe handling of concurrent AI moves

#### Performance
- Efficient icon scaling and positioning
- Minimal overhead for drag operations
- Optimized board updates and repainting

#### Compatibility
- Full backward compatibility with existing click-based system
- Works with all existing game features
- No changes required to other game components

## Usage Instructions

### For Players
1. **Click Mode**: Click on a piece to select it, then click on the destination square
2. **Drag Mode**: Press and hold on a piece, drag to the destination, and release
3. Both methods support all chess moves including special moves (castling, en passant, promotion)

### For Developers
The implementation is fully contained within `TilePanel.java` and requires no changes to other components. The drag and drop system:

- Respects all existing game rules and validation
- Integrates seamlessly with both AI and multiplayer modes
- Maintains compatibility with the existing codebase
- Provides a foundation for future UI enhancements

## Files Modified
- `Chess-main/ChessProject/src/main/java/chess_game/gui/TilePanel.java`

## Dependencies
The implementation uses only standard Java Swing components and existing chess game classes:
- `javax.swing.*` for UI components
- `java.awt.*` for graphics and event handling
- Existing chess game classes for move validation and execution

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements that could be added:
- Animated piece movements
- Sound effects for drag operations
- Touch screen support for mobile devices
- Customizable drag sensitivity settings
- Visual preview of valid moves during drag

## Testing
The implementation has been designed to work with:
- Both AI and multiplayer game modes
- All piece types and special moves
- Network connectivity variations (online/offline)
- Different screen sizes and resolutions
- Various Java Swing look and feel themes
