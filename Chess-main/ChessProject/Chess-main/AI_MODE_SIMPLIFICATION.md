# AI Mode Color Selection Removal

## Change Summary
Removed the color selection dialog in AI mode to streamline the user experience. The AI mode now automatically starts with the player as WHITE and the AI as BLACK.

## What Was Changed

### 1. **Removed Color Selection Dialog**
- **Before**: Clicking "AI Play" showed a dialog asking the user to choose between WHITE and BLACK
- **After**: Clicking "AI Play" directly starts the game with player as WHITE

### 2. **Modified AI Play Button Handler**
**File**: `Table.java`
**Location**: Line 101-112

**Before**:
```java
this.mainMenu.getAIPlayBTN().addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        playerName = mainMenu.getPlayerName();
        showColorSelectionAndCreateAIGame();
    }
});
```

**After**:
```java
this.mainMenu.getAIPlayBTN().addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        playerName = mainMenu.getPlayerName();
        if (playerName == null || playerName.trim().isEmpty()) {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(gameFrame, "Please enter your player name in the main menu.");
            return;
        }
        // Directly create AI game with player as WHITE (no color selection)
        createAIGamePanel(Team.WHITE);
    }
});
```

### 3. **Removed Unused Method**
Deleted the `showColorSelectionAndCreateAIGame()` method since it's no longer needed.

### 4. **Added Player Name Validation**
Added a check to ensure the player enters their name before starting an AI game, consistent with other game modes.

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UX**: Users can start an AI game with one click instead of two
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Player always starts as WHITE, which is traditional in chess
3. **Faster Game Start**: Eliminates an unnecessary dialog step
4. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused code and dialog dependency

## Technical Details

### Default Configuration
- **Player**: WHITE pieces (moves first)
- **AI**: BLACK pieces (moves second)  
- **Opponent Display**: "AI (Black)"

### Existing Functionality Preserved
- Load game functionality still works correctly
- AI difficulty and move calculation unchanged
- Save game functionality maintains compatibility
- Backwards compatibility method `createAIGamePanel()` still defaults to WHITE

### Files Modified
1. `Chess-main/ChessProject/src/main/java/chess_game/gui/Table.java`
   - Modified AI Play button handler
   - Removed `showColorSelectionAndCreateAIGame()` method
   - Added player name validation

### Files Unchanged
- `ColorSelectionDialog.java` - Kept for potential future use
- All AI logic and game mechanics remain identical
- Multiplayer functionality unaffected

## Testing

To test the change:
1. Launch the chess application
2. Enter a player name in the main menu
3. Click "AI Play"
4. Verify the game starts immediately with:
   - Player as WHITE pieces
   - AI as BLACK pieces
   - Player can make the first move
   - Turn indicator shows "Your Turn" initially

## Future Considerations

If color selection needs to be re-added in the future:
1. The `ColorSelectionDialog.java` file is still available
2. The `createAIGamePanel(Team)` method supports both WHITE and BLACK player teams
3. Simply restore the `showColorSelectionAndCreateAIGame()` method and update the button handler

## Migration Notes

- **Existing saved games**: No impact, load functionality works normally
- **User experience**: One less click to start AI games
- **Default behavior**: All new AI games will start with player as WHITE
