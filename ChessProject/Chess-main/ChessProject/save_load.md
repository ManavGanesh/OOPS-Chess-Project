## Technical Implementation Details

### Load Game Flow (Version 3.0)
1. User clicks "Load Game" → Shows list of saved games
2. User selects game → Shows mode selection dialog
3. User chooses mode → System enforces restrictions
4. For multiplayer games:
   - Connect to server (if needed)
   - Go directly to player selection page
   - Show status: "Select a player to continue saved game: [GameName]"
   - User selects player and sends load game request
   - Request includes game name and state information
   - Opponent sees: "[Player] wants to continue a saved game with you. Game: [GameName]"
   - When accepted, both players start with loaded game state
5. For AI games:
   - Load game state locally
   - Start AI game immediately

### Load Game Request System
1. **Request Creation**: PlayRequest includes load game information
   - `isLoadGameRequest = true`
   - `loadGameName = "Game Name"`
   - `loadGameState = GameState object`
2. **Request Display**: Opponent sees enhanced dialog
   - Shows game name and type
   - Clear indication it's a load game request
3. **Request Processing**: Normal play request flow
   - Same acceptance/rejection mechanism
   - Game state shared when accepted
4. **Game Start**: Loaded state applied before game panel creation

### Game State Preservation
- **Board State**: Complete board configuration preserved
- **Player Names**: Original player names maintained
- **Current Turn**: Correct turn indication based on saved state
- **Game Type**: AI vs multiplayer distinction preserved

## Testing Scenarios

2. Load AI game
3. Verify: Only offline mode available
4. Verify: Game loads with correct state
5. Verify: AI opponent works correctly

### Scenario 2: Load Multiplayer Game (Version 3.0)
1. Save multiplayer game
2. Load multiplayer game
3. Verify: Only multiplayer mode available
4. Verify: Goes directly to player selection page
5. Verify: Status shows "Select a player to continue saved game: [GameName]"
6. Verify: Select player and send request
7. Verify: Opponent sees load game request with game name
8. Verify: When accepted, game starts with correct state

### Scenario 3: Mixed Game Types
1. Save both AI and multiplayer games
2. Verify: Correct restrictions applied
3. Verify: Proper mode selection enforced

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Port Already in Use
**Problem:** Server fails to start due to port 4000 being occupied
**Solution:** Added proper error handling and port freeing mechanism

### Issue 2: Game Panel Created Before Pairing
**Problem:** Board opened immediately without waiting for opponent
**Solution:** Modified flow to wait for proper pairing and START message

### Issue 3: Fresh Board Instead of Loaded State
**Problem:** Loaded games started with fresh board
**Solution:** Enhanced createGamePanel() to detect and use loaded game state

### Issue 4: Pop-ups Instead of Player Selection (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Load game showed pop-ups instead of going to player selection
**Solution:** Modified showLoadGameDialog() to go directly to player selection page

### Issue 5: Missing Load Game Information in Requests (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Play requests didn't include load game information
**Solution:** Enhanced PlayRequest class and player selection handlers

## Recent Changes (Version 3.0)

### Enhanced User Flow
- **No More Pop-ups**: Load game goes directly to player selection
- **Clear Status Messages**: Shows game name in player selection
- **Enhanced Requests**: Play requests include game information
- **Better Communication**: Opponents see game details in requests

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Load Game Lobby**: Dedicated interface for finding opponents for specific games
2. **Game State Validation**: Verify loaded game states are valid
3. **Partial Game Loading**: Allow loading games from specific moves
